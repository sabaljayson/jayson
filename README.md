# tableau-server-beta-docker
Dockerfile for Tableau Server on Linux - Single Node. 

## Build
   
Be sure that your `EDITOR` environment variable is set then simply call `make`:

    make
    
## Run image

To boot (run) Tableau Server container simply execute:

    make run

It will call a `systemd` `/sbin/init` on the image and configure, register and start tableau server
on the first start.

To connect from a different terminal to the server itself use

    make exec
    
Pro tipp: If you commit the image state after the first execution (tableau configuration and registration) you don't
have to wait minutes next time.
